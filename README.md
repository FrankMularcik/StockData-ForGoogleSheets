# StockData-ForGoogleSheets
Python Script to read a google sheets file and write data based on the stocks in the spreadsheet.

This python script was uploaded to my github so that viewers of my YouTube Channel could see a simple script that I use to gather data
about different stocks that I own and to enter that data into a google spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my investments.
